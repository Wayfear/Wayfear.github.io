I'm excited to announce that I've graduated from Emory University with my PhD and have joined Meta Monetization GenAI as a Research Scientist! I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my advisors, Prof. Carl Yang and Prof. Ying Guo, for their exceptional guidance and support throughout my doctoral journey.
