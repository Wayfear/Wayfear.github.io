  abstract={There has been a growing interest in applying neuroimaging to investigate neurological underpinning of complex mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this work, we investigate the phenotypes of neuroimaging (e.g., brain connectivity) in relation to the self-reported clinical assessments of psychiatric scales of PTSD in an inner-city high risk population. We employ partial least square regression method to identify latent factors that explain connections between neuroimage phenotype and the PTSD psychiatric scales, while accommodating  the high dimensionality of the neuroimaging phenotype. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of a dataset from the Grady Trauma project and discuss our findings.}
