My name is Xuan Kan (阚璇). I obtained my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, advised by [Prof. Lin Zhang](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/linzhang/). During my undergraduate study, my research focused on pervasive and trustworthy systems design and implementation using machine learning methods supervised by <a href="https://christopherlu.github.io/">Dr. Xiaoxuan Lu</a> at University of Oxford. Besides, I interned at Smart City Group of SenseTime, working on improving neural network efficiency with Neural Architecture Search. 

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD degree in computer science at Emory University under the joint supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/">Dr. Carl Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.yingguo.us/">Dr. Ying Guo</a>. My research goal aims to design more efficienct and interpretable machine learning algorithms for fMRI data, which can assist in neurobiological findings and mental disease diagnosis.
