My name is Xuan Kan (阚璇). I am currently a Research Scientist in Meta Monetization GenAI, where I work on building next-generation advertising systems that serve billions of users through Generative AI technology. Specifically, I focus on improving the quality of AI-generated advertisements and enhancing overall advertising performance metrics.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Emory University under the joint supervision of [Prof. Carl Yang](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) and [Prof. Ying Guo](https://www.yingguo.us/). Through my doctoral research, I've been developing advanced computational methods to better analyze brain imaging data and contribute to the field of neuroinformatics. My research goal aims to design more efficient and interpretable machine learning algorithms for fMRI data, which can assist in neurobiological findings and mental disease diagnosis.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai. During my undergraduate study, my research focused on pervasive and trustworthy systems design and implementation using machine learning methods supervised by [Prof. Xiaoxuan Lu](https://christopherlu.github.io/) at University of Oxford. I also gained industry experience as an intern at the Smart City Group of SenseTime, where I worked on improving neural network efficiency through Neural Architecture Search techniques.
